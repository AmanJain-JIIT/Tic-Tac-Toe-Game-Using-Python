# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-Python
Using python language, this Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed as a 2-player game as well as a single player vs computer game


The playing grid is implemented using the concept of object oriented programming where each cell in a grid is an object of a class, where each object has three possible states "X", "O" and "BLANK"

For deciding the computer's move, Tic-Tac-Toe game dataset is used which after every user's move is checked for finding the most similar matrix to the current matrix so as to find the best move possible at the moment.
